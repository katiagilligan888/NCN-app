```sh
npm install
```

Make sure you copy the contract ABI from remix and paste it in the `public/config/abi.json` file.


After all the changes you can run.

```sh
npm run start
```

Or create the build if you are ready to deploy.

```sh
npm run build
```

Now you can host the contents of the build folder on a server.

That's it! you're done.
